Document by Javier SÃ¡nchez. Liking Likes.

Part I - recreate the layout and make the button work to increase the number of likes
Since we will be changing the number attached to a different element than the one we are clicking on we won't be able to use this this time.

Part II - recreate the website and make 3 different like buttons work.
Make sure that each like button only increases the like for that post. It's ok if we need to track each post's likes with separate variables but if we're careful we could store the likes in an array.
